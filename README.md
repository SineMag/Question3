# Question3
# Free time
It would be expected that I spend most of my free time resting since I’m working, but I spend most of it studying and relaxing. Also, I wake up early almost every day because my body is used to it. I take walks for around 30 min a day the come back indoors. I am an introvert so being indoors does not bother me at all. Most people prefer travelling and label it “change of scenery”, well I read books, mostly fictions. Also, I like to do some of the Grade 12 past papers whenever I miss school. I wouldn’t call myself a nerd, I just like obtaining new information. Since I couldn’t become a doctor, I watch a famous medical TV series and one of the books I’ve recently read was ‘Fat Tuesday” by Sandra Brown which I found interesting and would recommend it to any book lover. Growing up, cooking was not my strongest point but since the past few years I’ve enjoyed it and I do it not only for but for others who as well. Because I relate almost everything to mathematics, I see cooking as solving for numerical problems; sometimes you get it right the first try, sometimes you need to change the steps, and other times you need to use ‘simple’ in order to successfully complete the task!
